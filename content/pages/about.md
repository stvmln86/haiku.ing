Hello, I'm Stephen Malone and this is [haiku.ing](/), my daily metropolitan haiku journal. I love haiku poetry; the art of capturing a perfect moment in three lines of text. I also love cities and the whole metropolitan aesthetic, so this blog is my way of combining the two.

I try my best to post a new haiku every weekday (Australian time), so if you'd like to keep up you can follow me on Bluesky at [@haikuing][1] or subscribe to the [RSS feed][2]. If you have any questions or feedback, please message me on Bluesky or email [mail@haiku.ing][3].

Thank you for reading.
