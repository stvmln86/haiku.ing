Hello, I'm Stephen Malone and this is [haiku.ing](/), my daily journal of metropolitan haiku.

I've always been in love with haiku: the art of capturing a perfect moment in just three lines of text. I also love the metropolitan aesthetic: skyscrapers, coffee shops, shining valleys of glass and stone stretching out before us.

This journal is my way of combining these two loves and sharing my artistic attempts with the world. I post a new haiku every weekday, so if you'd like to keep up you can follow me on [Bluesky][1] or subscribe to the [RSS feed][2]. Finally, if you have any questions or feedback, please DM me on Bluesky or email [mail@haiku.ing][3].

Thank you for reading.
