a single magpie
— perhaps entirely by mistake —
appears at my door.

Hello and welcome to [haiku.ing](/), my personal haiku journal.
I've loved haiku for the longest time: it's one of the simplest forms of poetry, but it's also capable of such beautiful and complex imagery.
This journal is my attempt to participate in the art of haiku and share my work with the world.

I like to focus on the interconnection between nature and civilisation, as I personally find that the most poetic moments in life come from the conflict between these two forces.
Flowers in concrete, gardens on rooftops, sunsets reflected in skyscraper glass; to me these are images worth writing about.

I try my best to post a new haiku every weekday. To keep up, you can follow the [RSS][1] or follow me at [@haiku.ing][2] on Bluesky.
If you have any questions, you can message me on [Bluesky][2] or email me at [mail@haiku.ing][3].
Thank you.
